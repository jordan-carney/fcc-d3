A Collaborative Programming Project for FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Certificate

Welcome to this project. To get setup run:

  - `npm install` to install all dependencies
  - `npm run build ` to initalize the project with needed files
  - Inside of the dist folder (it's not tracked by git) put a simple `index.html` file
  with a div that has an id of `root` in the `body` tag of the file, i.e. `<div id='root'></div>`.
  - `npm start` to run the webpack dev server
    - You can go to `localhost:8080` after and you will see good ole' `Hello, world!` there to greet you!
  - `npm run test` to run tests with mocha
